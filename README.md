# Motion-Sensing-Lamp
Built using Arduino, it uses "SONAR" to calculate the distance between the obstacle and the module. The SONAR emits ultrasonic sound every 10 milliseconds, ad the time limit can be programmed accordingly.
I have set the thresh hold distance to be 5 meters, and when the obstacle crosses this threshhold, the light glows.
The concept was inspired from a similar project of an obstacle avoidance robot.
